## SDM
Based on my analysis, here's the level of effort required to split chat history storage between two PostgreSQL databases based on selected models:

Estimated Effort: **Moderate to High**

Key Modifications Required:

1. Database Connection Management (High Effort)
   - Modify db.py to support dynamic connection pool selection
   - Create model-specific connection pools to different databases
   - Update the get_db() context manager to choose databases based on model
2. Chat Storage Logic (Moderate Effort)
   - Update ChatTable methods to use model-specific database connections
   - Modify the routers to pass model information to the data layer
   - Update transaction handling for potential cross-database scenarios
3. Configuration Enhancements (Low Effort)
   - Add new environment variables for secondary database
   - Create model-to-database mapping configuration
   - Update Docker/deployment configurations
4. Data Migration (Moderate to High Effort)
   - Create migration scripts to handle existing chat data
   - Implement logic for determining which database receives existing chats
5. Cross-Database Operations (High Effort)
   - Handle search/retrieval across both databases when needed
   - Implement unified chat listing that queries both databases
   - Manage user access control across databases
6. Testing and Validation (Moderate Effort)
   - Test database failover scenarios
   - Validate data consistency across databases
   - Performance testing for multi-database operations

Implementation Challenges:

- Maintaining transaction integrity across separate databases
- Ensuring consistent user experience regardless of which database stores the chat
- Handling potential latency differences between databases
- Managing database-specific features or optimizations

Estimated Timeline:

1-2 weeks for an experienced developer familiar with the codebase, depending on the complexity of cross-database operations required.

## Sharing
Based on my analysis of the current access control system for chats in Open WebUI, here's the estimated level of effort required to implement individual user access alongside existing group
access:

Estimated Effort: **Low to Moderate**

Key Factors:

1. Existing Foundation (Reduces Effort)
   - The access control model already supports both user_ids and group_ids in its structure
   - The has_access() function already checks both individual users and groups
   - The database schema uses JSON fields that can accommodate the existing structure
2. Backend Modifications (Low Effort)
   - Add/update API endpoints for managing user-specific access (~1 day)
   - Enhance validation logic for access control changes (~0.5 day)
   - Add user search functionality for finding users to add (~0.5 day)
3. Frontend Modifications (Moderate Effort)
   - Create or update user selection UI component (~1-2 days)
   - Enhance the AccessControl.svelte component to handle individual users (~1-2 days)
   - Update the chat sharing UI to include individual user management (~1 day)
   - Add UI elements to display which users have access to a chat (~0.5 day)
4. Testing and Validation (Low Effort)
   - Test access control with different user/group combinations (~0.5 day)
   - Validate permission enforcement (~0.5 day)

Implementation Challenges:

- Ensuring good UX for selecting individual users vs. groups
- Handling edge cases (e.g., user appears in both individual access and group access)
- Managing notifications or emails to users when they're given access

Estimated Timeline:

1 week for a developer familiar with the codebase, with the majority of effort going to frontend components and user experience.

Overall Assessment:

The project is well-positioned for this enhancement as the core access control model already supports both user and group permissions. Most of the work will be in creating a good user interface
for managing individual access rather than making fundamental architectural changes.

## Retention
There is no automatic retention limit or expiration policy for chat history in Open WebUI. Chat history is stored indefinitely until manually deleted or archived by users or administrators.

The system includes:
1. An "archived" flag to mark chats as archived (but this doesn't delete them)
2. A "temporary chat" feature that allows conversations without saving to the database
3. Manual options for users to delete chats individually or in bulk

Users can control their chat history through these manual options, but there's no automatic pruning or TTL (time-to-live) settings in the codebase that would limit how long chats are stored.

## Logging
Open WebUI implements a comprehensive audit logging system with these key features:

1. Dedicated Audit Module
   - Located at /backend/open_webui/utils/audit.py
   - Implemented as middleware that captures HTTP requests and responses
2. Configurable Audit Levels
   - NONE: No audit logging
   - METADATA: Logs basic request metadata only
   - REQUEST: Logs request data plus metadata
   - REQUEST_RESPONSE: Logs full request and response data
3. What's Logged
   - User identification (ID, email when available)
   - IP addresses and user agents
   - HTTP details (method, path, status code)
   - Request/response bodies (configurable)
   - Timestamps for all actions
4. Security-Focused
   - Always logs authentication events (signin, signup, signout)
   - Redacts sensitive information automatically
   - Configurable path exclusions to avoid logging sensitive or high-volume endpoints
5. Storage & Retention
   - Logs stored in a dedicated audit log file (DATA_DIR/audit.log)
   - File rotation based on size with compression
   - JSON-formatted logs for easier analysis
6. Configuration Options
   - Log file path and rotation size
   - Maximum body size to capture
   - Paths to exclude from logging

Authentication events are prioritized for logging even when other paths are excluded. The system uses file-based storage rather than a database, with built-in log rotation but no automatic log
expiration mechanism.
